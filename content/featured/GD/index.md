The research accentuates to explore designing the drone frame using Generative design tools. A quadcopter is designed using Autodesk generative design embedded in Fusion 360. The simulation results such as static stress-strain, modal frequency and displacement results of additive manufactured quadcopter are compared with a DJI flame wheel F450 drone frame. The generative designed frame has minimum displacement compared to traditional designed drone frame. It is observed that generative designing technique along with additive manufactured frames yields better frames with improved resistance to fracture and minimum displacement compared to traditional designed DJI flame wheel F450 drone frame.
