Developed a Web App, with a customized trained Model using transfer learning and data augmentation, consisting of 100+ bird species. VGG16 pre-trained model was freezed and used alongside augmented training and validating images to increase the accuracy by keeping the computational eficiency in mind. An overall IOU of 96.5% was obtained when evaljuation of the trained model was computed with individual prediction going upto 98.73%.
