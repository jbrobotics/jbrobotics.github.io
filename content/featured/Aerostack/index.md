A behavior tree was used to specify the mission plan for the drone in an AEROSTACK framework. AEROSTACK helps developers design and build control architecture of aerial robot systems, integrating multiple heterogenous computational solutions. There are 2 important functions here: the behavior tree editor is used to set the missionplan using available behaviors and hierarchies, and the interpreter executes th ebehaviors set in the editor. The four behaviorals used in this video are Take-off, Follow path, Rotate and Land.
