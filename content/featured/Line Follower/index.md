Advanced PID based line follower equipped with the ability to find the shortest path using BUG2 algorithm alongside the PID algorithm. The controller's PID algorithm restores the measured speed to the desired speed with minimal delay and overshoot. Bug2 algorithm employs greedy algorithm and it will take the first path that looks better.
Algorithm: PID and BUG2 algorithm.
